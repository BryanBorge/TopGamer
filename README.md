# Senior Project - BCS430 - Spring 2019

Course Objective: Develop an information system that includes analysis, design planning and organization of a real life or simulated situation.

With our combined knownledge and similar academic history, our group chose to develop a Java application, which uses an Azure SQL database, to manage video game tournaments. We created all documentation: context diagrams, ER diagram and database schema, user stories, data flow, and test plans etc. We gained valuable experince learning how to separate business, presentation and data access layers. We got introduced to working in sprints, doing sprint retrospectives, presenting our progress after each sprint, maintaining user stories and a backlog. 


# UPDATE - 3/3/2020

I found out a few months back that for some reason our Azure database no longer exists. The account is valid and I can still sign on, however, the database is missing. That pretty much breaks the whole program. If anyone were to download it and try to run it there would be hundreds of errors.
