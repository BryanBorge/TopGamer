#Senior Project - BCS430 - Spring 2019

Course Objective: Develop an information system that includes analysis, design planning and organization of a real life or simulated situation.

With our combined knownledge and similar academic history, our group chose to develop a Java application, which uses an Azure SQL database, to manage video game tournaments. We created all documentation: context diagrams, ER diagram and database schema, user stories, data flow, and test plans etc. We got introduced to working in sprints, doing sprint retrospectives, presenting our progress after each sprint, maintaining user stories and a backlog.
